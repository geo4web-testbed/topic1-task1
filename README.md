Modern Ways of Spatial Data Publishing
--------------------------------------

The research question to answer is: “How do the other lessons learned within the GeoNovum tender meet the constraints (e.g. budgets) and capabilities (e.g. in-house know-how) of governmental organizations on the one hand, and of data users on the other?”

Steps involved in the high-quality publication of spatial data
==============================================================

  1. Obtaining public data (⋆⋆).
  2. Converting the data to an open format that can be freely read by SotA tools (⋆⋆⋆).
  3. Converting open format data to Linked Data with a straightforward mapping.
  4. Perform a recorded sequence of Linked Data transformations in order to raise the quality of the data (⋆⋆⋆⋆).
  5. Once the data has high enough quality it can be linked to external sources (⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆).
  6. Data publication ensuring high performance and high availability.
  7. Data exposure through APIs and interaction paradigms the users like / want / already know.
  8. Getting users to recognize the value of your data, resulting in real-world use.

Some of the earlier steps can be expressed in the 5⋆ Linked Data model.  The challenges encountered in step (1) and (8) are different from the others: they are organization rather than technical.  Step (2) and (3) are already well-known and can be easily quantified.  Step (4) and (5) are challenging: ATM these are either high-costly or low-quality.  Rather than finding a ‘silver bullet’ here, we try to formulate an upgrade path from low-cost/low-quality to high-cost/high-quality.  The main requirement for the upgrade path is that the cost/benefit trade-off is at most linear.  Step (6) is a well-known problem in Linked Data publishing.  Luckily, significant improvements have been made recently that allow the performance/availability trade-off to be made on a more fine-grained level.  Step (7) is largely depends on formulating the intended user groups and gaining knowledge about their existing capabilities and preferences.
